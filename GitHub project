I am interested mostly in ocean farming, specifically in oyster and seaweed farming. 
Id like to start my own farm, own my own hatchery where I grow oyster seed/grow shellfish and seaweed. 
Eventually Id like to start a program where I teach minority groups, focused mostly on women of color, 
and teach them the basic and necessary skills to start a business, start ocean farms, grow shellfish, etc.
